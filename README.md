# Datatables-inline-edit
Custom inline edit functionality for Datatables jQuery plugin. 

This script provides (only) the front-end implementation that adds inline-editing functionality to Datatables jQuery Plugin and some sample back-end code.

NOTE: Code is part of a bigger project, so there might be references to missing variables, etc. The script aims to demonstrate how could someone approach this functionality without using the paid plugin and it isn't fully functional by itself.
